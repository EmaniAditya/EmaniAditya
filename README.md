Hi there! I'm Aditya, 

In my freshmen year, I love diving into open-source projects...especially in the areas of Web3 and NLP. My skills include Python, C, Java, Cloud Computing, Git and GitHub. I'm dedicated to continuously improving and making an impact in these fields. In my free time, When I'm not coding, you can find me on Chess.com....
